# Medical Tracker.
This was my final project for CSCI 2270. I worked on this in VS Code and used C++. The goal is to help organize the patients ID's in the most optimal data structure. In this project I looked at a few different types of data structures I looked at doubly linked lists, and hash tables including linear probing, quadratic probing, and chaining with a linked list. I had to impliment each of these types of data structures, and then test each one by inserting 10,000 patient ID's. I was then able to time how long it look to insert, and how long it took to search each of these data structures, and test this 100 times. With this data I was then able to analyze and see what data structure was optimal for the medical tracker. I was able to make graphs in Excel in order to fully understand what the best data type was, which is in the 2270  Final Project Writup.docx file.
